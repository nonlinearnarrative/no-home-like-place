# No Home Like Place

Interactive tool to explore Airbnb listings through the use of object-recognition software.

Objects that are detected within the listing photo are replaced by images of the same object type from other listing photos. These objects are cropped and resized to the bounding box of the original object. Clicking on an object take you to the listing photo where it comes from.

## Tools used
[`scrape-airbnb`](https://github.com/nonlinearnarrative/scrape-airbnb) – Scrapes metadata from from Airbnb listings and saves them as JSON files.

[`airbnb-object-recognition`](https://github.com/nonlinearnarrative/airbnb-object-recognition) – Creates a collection of JSON files with recognized objects in photos of Airbnb listings.

## About this project
`No Home Like Place` was created as part of a workshop at [Non-Linear Narrative](https://www.kabk.nl/en/programmes/master/non-linear-narrative) at Royal Academy of Art The Hague.
